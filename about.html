 <a>The purpose of our project is to obtain a surrogate model for the Kinetic MonteCarlo Simulations used by SSparks. </a>

<a> Kinetic Montecarlo is the most commonly used model to describe grain growth as well as one of the most accurates, if you want to know more about Kinetic Montecarlo please click [here](http://spparks.sandia.gov/). </a>

This model works in the microscale lengthscale, nevertheless the effects of the grain size are observed in a larger scale, mesoscale. We want to bridge these 2 different lengthscales by using the surrogate model that we will develop. 

The goal is to be able to predict with sufficient accuracy the process history necessary to obtain a desired grain size based on an initial microstructure in a computationally and timely effcient manner. 

The relevance of this project is based on the fact that the grain size of the finished part is extremly important since it defines a great variety of properties like yield stength. 

This surrogate model will hopefully aid designers in obtaining an efficent tool that they can use as part of their design process since they can effectively define a process for a desired final grain size.

The development of this model will be done by employing the tools learned during the ME8883 Class. Observe the progress of our project by reading our posts.
