        <li>Make the Utah robotics team successful</li>
        <li>Work on robotics and coding projects</li>
        <li>Get a girlfriend</li>
        <li>Gain weight/muscles</li>
        <li>Finish up things that need to be done for RISS</li>
        <li>Maintain relationships that you feel are beneficial</li>
        <li>Be fun to talk to and be around</li>
        <li>Getting overall smarter and more productive</li>
    </ul>
</div>

## Anti-priorities

<div id="anti">
These things should specifically not be done. They have been shown to waste a lot of time.  Unless things are pertinent to one of the priorities, they should not be used.  It is good to explore a bit, but not much.  Doing the direct thing that is a priority is the most important.  You don't learn to hang out with people by reading about it.  You learn by actually hanging out with people.  You have to dedicate specific time to it.  You should be able to learn to do these things without having to "expand your horizons".  For talking to people: just be interested in them.  That is all you need to do.

    <ul>
        <li>reddit</li>
        <li>News (besides that which should be common knowledge, like you would be weird for not knowing: ex. Persching scandal)</li>
    </ul>
</div>
