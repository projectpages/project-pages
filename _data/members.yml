  bio: "Fred is a first-year Ph.D. student studying Computational Science and Engineering in the College of Computing at Georgia Institute of Technology. He received his undergraduate degrees in applied mathematics and physics at The University of Georgia where he explored 3D printing in topology by observing the physical geometry of knots that are particularly hard to visualize. His interests include the broad fields of data science, digital design, and visualization."

  bio: "David Montes de Oca Z. is currently pursuing a PhD in Mechanical Engineering at Georgia Institute of Technology. He earned his bachelor’s degree in Mechanical Engineering form the Georgia Institute of Technology in December 2014. He started GRAD School in Georgia Tech Lorraine, Georgia Tech’s Satellite Campus in France. David has little experience in research nevertheless he has a strong Professional Experience. He has done a Co-op with Toyota Motor Manufacturing and an Internship with Nissan North America. This partnered with his multicultutral experience, since he has performed studies abroad in top notch universities in France and China, has tuned his analytical skills and his ability to solve complex problems by using a progression of reasonable, attainable and measurable solutions and to approach a problem with a globally oriented mindset. His current Research Focus is in finding a viable substitute for the Lead-Tin Solder Alloys by an intercalation of Multiscale Simulations and experimentation."
