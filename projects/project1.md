## Introduction & Background:

With power of face recognition, many previous unimaginable tasks become tangible and achievable.

However, cost, in both human force and pecuniary investment, for creating large-scale and pure face dataset is still very high. Only big companies and institutions have enough support to construct such dataset as mentioned above and some are not open-source, which restricts the development for both industry and academic research.

This project aims at inventing an efficient automatic filtering method to construct a human face datasets,HKU-face. Besides, metric learning problem, one of essential parts for backpropagation process, will also be experimented and researched based on the face dataset.
